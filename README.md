# Jacy Chu — Work & Impact Portfolio

This portfolio highlights how I translate complex technical workflows into clear, adoptable processes that improve cross-functional collaboration and delivery. It consolidates selected engineering work, workflow redesign initiatives, and long-term impact across product, design, and engineering teams.

A key feature is my signature demo **“From Insight to Impact”**, a 2.5-minute highlight distilled from a 105-minute hands-on workshop that guided the adoption of Figma and reshaped our team’s design-to-engineering workflow for over four years.

## 🧩 What This Portfolio Represents
- Turning ambiguous problems into structured, scalable workflows  
- Driving adoption of new tools and practices across distributed teams  
- Communicating complex concepts through clear demos, systems thinking, and enablement  
- Delivering measurable impact through UI/UX refinement and engineering improvements  

## 🔍 Featured Work
- **Workflow transformation:** Figma-based design-to-engineering alignment  
- **Front-end engineering:** Scalable UI components, design systems, cross-platform patterns  
- **Cross-functional enablement:** Workshops, documentation, and knowledge sharing
